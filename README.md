# Timed-Quiz-HW4

## Description
Aside from practicing more JS coding skills and infusing some HTML and CSS together, this short quiz is meant to help people practice some of their coding terminology. Each problem has four choices (6 problems total), and high scores are determined by accuracy (number of problems someone gets) as well as how much time remained (out of 1.5 minutes). Should the user opt out of taking the quiz, the page will close. 

## Installation

## Usage
In theory, a student who is learning coding could practice and see how well they know their HTML, CSS, and JS terminology and compare their scores to other students (or with their prior attempts).

## Credits
Aside from my instructor and TA, one of my tutoring sessions was helpful in adjusting the countdown timer as well as understand some of the code that I used as a template from one website, which is https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/how-to-create-a-simple-javascript-quiz/.  I also utilized w3schools.com as well as stackoverflow.com.
