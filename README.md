# Timed-Quiz-HW4

## Description
Aside from practicing more JS coding skills and infusing some HTML and CSS together, this short quiz is meant to help people practice some of their coding terminology. Each problem has four choices (10 problems total), and high scores are determined by accuracy (number of problems someone gets) as well as how much time remained (out of 2 minutes). The problem list also randomly sorts through an array of 20 questions, which means that some quizzes will not have the same problems as others.
